# FastWorld
Making your Hallownest more challenging by changing speed of the entire world, except you!

# Usage
1. Install the mod from Lumafly/Scarab
2. Run the game once (to make Sanic mod generate a save file).
3. Look for `Sanic.GlobalSettings.json` in the HK's save folder and open it:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight\`
   - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/unity.Team Cherry.Hollow Knight/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/Team Cherry/Hollow Knight/`
4. Change the timescale value to whatever you want (default value from Sanic is 1.3). And enjoy!
